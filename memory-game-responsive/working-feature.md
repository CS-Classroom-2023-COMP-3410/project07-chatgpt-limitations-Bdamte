# what works?
so this works like 95% but i wasnt sure as what to do when it got to the phone size. i didnt want to make the game container any smaller than it was but the fruits were behind it on the sides. i should just make it smaller. 

# what i changed
i made the game continaer smaller and centerd it in the middle with the fruit border. i made sure the game container doesnt overlap the fruit border. I also changed the genertefruitborder() to update teh positions when it resizes the window.
